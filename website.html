    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p id="firstParagraph">This is a paragraph. It has an 'id' which is individual, and specific only to a single HTML object. This is so you can identify and style a single object on the page with CSS.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>h3 is a smaller header than h1</h3>
      <p>Below is an example for using images in a site:</p>
      <img src="https://about.pinterest.com/sites/all/themes/custom/pinterest/images/pinterest-footer-logo.png" />
      <p>...and this is a link to another page in your site or another website all together:</p>
      <a href="http://adambreznicky.com/">Super cool website!</a>
    </div>

      This is an example list. It demonstrates how CSS 'classes' work so you can style a group of HTML objects by all in the same way by giving them each the same 'class'.
      <ul> <!-- 'ul' stands for unordered list. html auto creates bullets for each -->
        <li>Corvette Stingray</li> <!-- 'li' stands for list item. -->
        <li class="styleTheSame">Dodge Challenger</li>
        <li class="styleTheSame">Ford Mustang</li>
        <li>Chevy Vega</li>
        <li class="styleTheSame">Pontiac GTO</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
